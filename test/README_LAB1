BY SUBMITTING THIS FILE TO CARMEN, I CERTIFY THAT I HAVE PERFORMED ALL
OF THE WORK TO DETERMINE THE ANSWERS FOUND WITHIN THIS FILE MYSELF WITH
NO ASSISTANCE FROM ANY PERSON OTHER THAN THE INSTRUCTOR OF THIS COURSE
OR ONE OF OUR UNDERGRADUATE GRADERS.

1. Name: 
Sooyoung Jeon

2. UNIX is proprietary system (i.e. you must purchase a license) while Linux is an Open Source system. An Open Source system, however, is not always “free”. Why?
There should be somewhat a way to support the Linux to keep on going. Companies pay for it to advoate which will help to fix bugs or improve the current system.

3. Within gdb, the value of the variable i before the initialization is:
0

4. Within gdb, the value of the variable i after the initialization is:
1

5. What does touch do and why did it change the behavior of make?
Touch can either create a new empty file or renew the current file with the name typed.

6. In gdb, you walked through the code using next and using step – describe the differences in their behavior:
Both step and next execute the current line and move on to the next line. If the next line is a function, code next will execute it and display the result while the code step goes into the function and start with the steps in the function.

7. In gdb, what did finish do?
Code finish will complete the current function first and wait the user until the result returns from the function.

8. On the final run, after you set the value of x to 200, what was the value of i back in the calling function?
200

Lab1 c file, lab1.c, and lab1 header file, include.h were found in the tags file.

10.How do the contents of the .vs file compare to your C code?
