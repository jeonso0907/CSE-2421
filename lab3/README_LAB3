Lab 3 was harder than lab 2, but was a meaningful time to review my lab 2 logic mistakes while reinforce and apply new logics for lab 3. It was much easier to move the data in between each function, but still required to consider some sensitive cases. Calculating the appropriate effective delta time and placing the appropriate output messages with specific position were the hardes things I have experienced.
