It was hard time for me to understand the lab instruction and figure out the appropriate methods to apply with my coding. Unlike JAVA, it required more specific rules for C, which took a long time for me to work on this lab. However, all of those process helped ma to learn and understand the brief idea of this course. Especially, communication through piazza helped me a lot. I hope we can keep in touch throught piazza to work on the labs for this semester like this one.
