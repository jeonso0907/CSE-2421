Lab 4 had to only implement the linked list functions. While the functions only required to handle the previous lab3's functions and data, it still took some time to think and connect the functions. Especially handling withthe pointers inthe linked list functions, I had to pay more attention to not lost the allocating and freeing the nodes.
